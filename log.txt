2019-06-10 0:58 change to small screen, nav bar becomes vertical
        10:00
        #top, #banner, #contents, #main, article {
        width: 400px;
        }   
        change these width to 400px. The text is inside the window 
        when the screen size reduced. (Maybe I used a lot of margins 
        so I have to reduced more) 

        Problem: change .gallery to 3000px for samll screen NOT working
        looks like the height has max height
